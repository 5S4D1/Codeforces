# Codeforces Solutions

This repository contains solutions to a wide range of problems from [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com), one of the most popular competitive programming platforms. The solutions are implemented mainly in **C++**, with some problems solved in **C** and **Python**.


## Repository Structure

- 📁 **Difficulty_A/**, **Difficulty_B/**, **Difficulty_C/**: Problems are now organized into folders based on their Codeforces difficulty level (A, B, C). Each folder contains solution files named after the problem IDs (e.g., `1A.c`, `230B.cpp`, `1950C.cpp`).
- 📁 **Assiut_University_Training/**: Themed problem sets or training camp solutions.
- 📝 This structure makes it easier to browse and find problems by their difficulty.

**Note:** For the complete and up-to-date contents, please [browse the repository on GitHub](https://github.com/5S4D1/Codeforces/tree/main).
